# Euphoria
Euphoria is a MERN stack-based concert booking platform where users can:

   Explore upcoming shows of different bands.

   Book seats by submitting payment proof (via UPI).

   View their confirmed bookings.

   Request cancellations, which the admin can approve.

The Admin has full control:

   Add new shows.

   View booking requests and approve them (triggers confirmation email to the user).

   Manage cancellation requests and approve them (removes booking from user).

   This project was built as a full-stack web application to learn and implement the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack.
